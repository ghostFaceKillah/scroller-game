@implementation Monster

// ideas for monsters
// * just goblin - he has two modes - going forward defenceless and second attacking whatever is in front of him
// * spike - you have to dodge him - no method for killing this guy
// * rocket - this guy first runs onto screen and floats around, and later it attacks you directly, but is slow
// to change direction so you can dodge him and he hits floor/etc and kills himself
// * archer - pretty much self-explainatory
// * tower - an untouchable guy at the bottom and another guy to be hit at the bottom

// need to implement probabilistic spawning of monsters
