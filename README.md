# scroller-game

We made a game with [Janek](https://github.com/jan-gajl) in 2015, in objective C.
- We never released it. 
- I did actually release [other game, Planetoid](https://kwcodes.com/how-i-failed-5-side-projects-in-6-years-earning-0/) with my friend [Krzysztof](kwcodes.com).
- I still love objective C.
- BTW, Apple had a memory leak and crashes in SpriteKit. It was just released.
No-one believed me back then, but it was true in the end, lol.
I had to have a pool of initialized sprites and kept reusing it to prevent it from crashing.
- It stars white, blonde, "cute" female hero, so that's low key cringe when I look at it now. Buuuut that was long time ago
and I had not much life context, so I guess I have to live with it and accept it for what it is.
